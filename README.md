# Jasmine BDD tests with FizzBuzz code
A simple FizzBuzz example of how to work with the [Jasmine BDD framework](http://pivotal.github.io/jasmine/)

## How to run
1. Just open `index.html`

## Where is what
* `lib/` contains a standalone version of [Jasmine](https://github.com/pivotal/jasmine/downloads)
* `src/` contains your Javascript files
* `spec/` contains the specs/tests for your Javascript
* `spec/helpers` contains DocumentTitleReporter and images to add the result to the windows title. 
Could be used to keep your `index.html` minimized and still see tests passing/failing.
